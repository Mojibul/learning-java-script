You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a "for loop" because it runs "for" a specific number of times.

var ourArray = [];

for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

  ourArray.push(i);

}

ourArray will now contain [0,1,2,3,4] 

Let's try getting a for loop to work by pushing values to an array.

Example:

var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.

// Push the numbers zero through four to myArray using a "for loop" like above.

for (var i = 0; i<5 ; i++){
  myArray.push(i);
}
