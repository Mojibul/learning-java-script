Another way to change the data in an array is with the .pop() function.

.pop() is used to "pop" a value off of the end of an array. We can retrives this 
value by performing pop() in a variable declaration.

Any type of variable can be "popped" of an array.


Example: 

var myArray = ["Jaman",23,["Dog",3]];
var removed = myArray.pop()// This should be ["Dog",3] and myArray should now be ["Jaman",23]


Use the .pop() function to remove the last item form myArray
