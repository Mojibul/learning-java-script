There are many ways to add and remove properties from objects.

For example, we can add properties to objects like this:

myObject.myProperty = "myValue";

We can also delete them like this:

delete myObject.myProperty;

Let's add the property "bark", and delete the property "tails".

Example: 

var myDog = {
   "name": "Camper",
   "legs": 4,
   "tails": 1,
   "friends": []
};

// Only change code below this line.

// Let's add the property bark to myDog
myDog.bark = 1;
delete myDog.tails;
