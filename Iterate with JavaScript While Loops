You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

Another type of JavaScript loop is called a "while loop", because it runs "while" something is true and stops once that something is no longer true.

var ourArray = [];

var i = 0;

while(i < 5) {

  ourArray.push(i);

  i++;

}

Let's try getting a while loop to work by pushing values to an array.

Example:

var myArray = [];
// Only change code below this line.
var i  = 0;
// Push the numbers zero through four to myArray using a "while loop".
while (i<5){
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
