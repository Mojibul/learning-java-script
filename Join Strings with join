We can use the .join() method to join each element in an array into a string separated by whatever delimiter you provide as an argument to the join operation.

var joinMe = joinMe.join(" ");

Example:

var joinMe = ["Split","me","into","an","array"];
// Only change code below this line.

joinMe = joinMe.join(" ");
